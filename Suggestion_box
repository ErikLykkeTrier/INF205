Here we can write suggestions for how to solve the problem of the spheres.

We can sort all spheres based on size, place the big ones first in cubes of spheres, then try to fit smaller spheres inbetween.

The Monty Carlo method :)


Need to fix collisons, if two spheres are in the same two boxes it wil count 2 collisions and not one

Need to add comments
nned to make code prettyer
